    \section{Research Question}
    This project was aimed to evaluate a method for pathway activity and to test it in the context of breast cancer. As gene expression by itself is often



    \section{Breast Cancer}
    Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women (WHO), accounting for nearly 15\% of all cancer deaths among women.
    Breast cancer has been studied for a long time, with the earliest paper recorded in PubMed from 1789 to almost 25 000 papers in 2019. The sad truth is though giant leaps in detection and treatments have been made since 1789, we still cannot call breast cancer a cured disease.
